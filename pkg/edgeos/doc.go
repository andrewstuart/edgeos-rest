// Package edgeos provides a Go client for interfacing with EdgeOS devices. It
// has been developed and tested against the ERLite running v1.9.1 firmware.
// Thus far, it serves primarily to expose high-level generic functionality as
// well as a specific implementation for the port forwarding features.
